## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This repository contains code and resources for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. The primary goal is to demonstrate techniques for preparing raw data for analysis, focusing on steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization, and more.

### Contents

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks covering various data cleaning operations.
- **Sample Datasets**: Example datasets used for demonstrating preprocessing techniques.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for reusable data transformation functions.

### Key Features

- Handling missing data (imputation, removal)
- Feature encoding (label encoding, one-hot encoding)
- Data normalization and scaling
- Removing duplicates
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) utilities

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantg0501/Task1-ElevateLabs-.git
